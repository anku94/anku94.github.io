### Problem: Need Sudo To Probe

```bash
perf probe -x ./code --add='add_with_sleep:0 sleep_us'
```

This will fail without `sudo` unless you're root. A solid [setup][2] that fixes most perf permissions issues:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug
sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
sudo chown root:tracing /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/uprobe_events
sudo chmod g+rw /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/uprobe_events

```

### Probing Internal Library Functions

You're going through the source code of your library, and there's a specific internal function you want to profile. But it's not listed in `perf probe -x exec -F`. It probably isn't listed in `nm -a exec` either. If your functions are using this:

```c
static __inline__ FN __attribute__((always_inline));
```

There's no way they're making it to the compiled output.  This must be deleted. With `__inline__` and `inline`, things vary. There are two things I needed to get gcc to preserve my symbols up to the final `.so` object:

1. Remove `always_inline` from code
2. Add `-fvisibility=default` to my compiler flags
3. Add `-fno-inline` to counter the anti-debugging forces channeled by `-O3`
