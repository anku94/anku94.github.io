Let us say that we managed to build extremely intelligent beings, with their cognitive dials turned all the way up.

What will they discover? Will it be a superset of what we know? Can it directly contradict what assume to have proved?

If our logical and mathematical tools are universal, then any entity, regardless of how smart it is, would discover the same tools on the road to bigger things.

But are they? What makes them universal?

Is it causality? Our ways of knowledge are centered around causality --- we seek to know if A implies B and C does not imply B, so that we can, say, remove C, amp up A, and as a result get more control over B.

Does causality automatically imply these rules?

Does this somehow mean that there might be other ways of "knowing"? Can we gain something by trading off causality?
